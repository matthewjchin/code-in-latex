# code-in-latex
Coursework in mathematics which required the use of LaTeX in typing up of equations.

Some work was written as part of documentation for community service experiences as volunteer math tutor. 
There are also some snippets of practicing writing code of equations in LaTeX form. 
Also included are images of some exercises done involving geometric concepts.
